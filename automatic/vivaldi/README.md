It's a browser. But fun. It comes with a bunch of clever features built-in. It's freakishly flexible and private too.

## What makes Vivaldi different?

### More features, not less

You spend a lot of time in your browser. It should do everything you need out-of-the-box. Vivaldi comes with built-in features like Notes, Screen Capture, Image Properties and (a lot) more.

### Everything's an option

We want Vivaldi to work for anyone so we give you options. Lots and lots of options. You choose how Vivaldi works, what features to use and how it looks. This is your browser, after all.

### There are no rules

How your browser works is up to you. There are multiple ways to access and control most things in Vivaldi. Play around and find what works for you.

### Your browser, your business

Being “privacy first” is not something we say lightly. We don’t track you. And we mean it. Nothing, zero, zilch. Making the browser is our job. How you use it is none of our business.
