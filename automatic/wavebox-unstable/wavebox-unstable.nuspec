    <description>Wavebox is a revolutionary and feature-rich Chromium browser that's built for productive working across Google Workspaces, Microsoft Teams, ClickUp, Monday, Atlassian, Asana, AirTable, Slack, and every other web app you use to get work done.

### Features

* Stay signed-in.
  We've nailed the tech behind multiple account sign-in so you can stay signed-in to everything without using profiles or switching browsers. Stay signed-in to all your web apps, including multiple Gmail, Monday, Asana, or ClickUp accounts.
* Blazingly fast.
  Go from 0 to 60 apps in under 2 seconds. Wavebox replaces browser switching and tab toggling with one intelligent platform that throttles memory on the fly to give you a fast and flawless performance as you work.
* Intuitive navigation.
  Let muscle memory take over. Vertical and horizontal toolbars provide fast access to all your web resources. Quick Switch and customizable Keyboard Shortcuts speed up navigation between everything. Tabs are arranged by group or app, so you'll stay in context whilst you work.
* Multiway split screen.
  Smooth, flexible, and totally addictive, our split screen feature has to be seen to be believed. Optionally set different split screen configurations for each group to optimize your workflow. You'll wonder how you ever worked without it!
* Flexible project workspaces.
  Use workspaces to bring together web resources for any project. Add links to documents, shortcuts to web apps, sticky notes, desktop notification list and much more. Keep them private or share with a team-you can also use workspaces to create a time-saving new tab page.
* App-to-app workflows.
  We all hop between web apps like Trello, ClickUp and Jira to complete daily tasks. That's why we've made everything work together. Click a Grammarly link in ClickUp and it will open in Grammarly...why wouldn't it? Wavebox learns as you work across apps, so the more you use it the easier it gets.
* All Chrome extensions.
  You can use any extension from the Chrome Web Store in Wavebox such as Grammarly, Boomerang and Lastpass. We also have a growing number of unique extensions baked into our browser offering features that are technically not possible with a Chrome extension.
* Unified search.
  All your project work is currently scattered across the web with no easy way to search. Wavebox unites everything under one roof, so you can keyword search to quickly find what you need in any tab, widget, page or window. You can even keyword search across all your Gmail and Google Drive accounts!
