VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

To verify the files using the project source:

1. If the version you need to verify is a stable (ie. non-prerelease version) then they can be found on https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/ where you can download the binary and verify the checksum.
2. If the version you need to verify is a prerelease version, then these may be available on https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows but the most recent prerelease and stable version is all that is kept there.

Checksums:
