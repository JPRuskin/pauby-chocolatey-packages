- This package can take upwards of 10 minutes to complete the install (depending on your computer specs, internet bandwidth etc.).
- The uninstall for this package **is not silent**.
- This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
