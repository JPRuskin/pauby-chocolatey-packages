This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->
<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

        <description>Firefox customizations for a full dark theme, multi-row tabs, custom scrollbar, and other functions.

This theme is mainly intended to be used alongside a lightweight theme, and for the stable release of Firefox (This means that while it will most probably work with nightly and ESR for the most part, it may have less support for those versions). You can use it to fully change the colors of most of firefox UI to dark-gray colors (with #222-#444 colors mostly), including scrollbars, tooltips, sidebar, as well as dialogs. With the files here you can also as remove some context menu options, enable multirow tabs, change the font of the url bar.

### How To Use

This package drops the Firefox Quantum Nox binary into the tools folder and calls it `quantum-nox.exe`. It will also be shimmed so can be run directly from the PATH.

You can execute the `quantum-nox.exe`, with [parameters](https://github.com/Izheil/Quantum-Nox-Firefox-Dark-Full-Theme/wiki/Installer-console-commands) while installing the package. Anything you pass to Chocolatey in the `--params` parameter will be passed unaltered. So for example `choco install firefox-quantum-nox --params="'--multirow --multirow-version 2 --megabar'"` will run `quantum-nox.exe --multirow --multirow-version 2 --megabar` at the package install time. To run any commands after the package has been installed just run `quantum-nox.exe` with the parameters, from the command line.

### Virus Detections

The binary is a wrapped Python script and because of this, has been detected by various AV scanners. See [this issue](https://github.com/Izheil/Quantum-Nox-Firefox-Dark-Full-Theme/issues/54) for more information.

**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
