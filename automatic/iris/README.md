Iris is software for eye protection, health and productivity.

The 2 most popular features of Iris which probably brought you here are:

* You can decrease the amount of blue light emitted from the screen
* Control the brightness without PWM flicker

There are several different modes and several different types of Iris. These are basically some preset values that many people use. Aside from this you can customize Iris a lot. I know that it can be a little hard for non-technical people, but I'm doing my best to make it as easy to use as possible.

By default Iris works automatically and detects if it's day or night. Based on that it will change your screen Color Temperature and Brightness. When you open the control panel of the program you can select different modes and types of Iris.
