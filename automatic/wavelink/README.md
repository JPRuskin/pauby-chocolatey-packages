Wave Link is the audio mixing software for the Elgato Wave microphones. Together with the Wave microphone, up to eight other audio sources can be mixed together and two separate outputs; a monitor mix and a stream mix are created. 

Inputs into Wave Link can be program audio, such as games, Discord voice chat, music, web browsers, other microphone inputs and capture cards. 

NOTE: This application states that ONLY supports Windows 10 x64 and later. If you use it on anything than Windows 10 x64 you won't be supported by Elgato and your mileage may vary.
