    <!-- This section is about this package, although id and version have ties back to the software -->
    <!-- id is lowercase and if you want a good separator for words, use '-', not '.'. Dots are only acceptable as suffixes for certain types of packages, e.g. .install, .portable, .extension, .template -->
    <!-- If the software is cross-platform, attempt to use the same id as the debian/rpm package(s) if possible. -->
    <id>wavelink</id>
    <!-- version should MATCH as closely as possible with the underlying software -->
    <!-- Is the version a prerelease of a version? https://docs.nuget.org/create/versioning#creating-prerelease-packages -->
    <!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->
    <version>1.4.1.2726</version>

    <summary>Wave Link is the audio mixing software for the Elgato Wave microphones.</summary>
    <description>Wave Link is the audio mixing software for the Elgato Wave microphones. Together with the Wave microphone, up to eight other audio sources can be mixed together and two separate outputs; a monitor mix and a stream mix are created. 

Inputs into Wave Link can be program audio, such as games, Discord voice chat, music, web browsers, other microphone inputs and capture cards. 

NOTE: This application states that ONLY supports Windows 10 x64 and later. If you use it on anything than Windows 10 x64 you won't be supported by Elgato and your mileage may vary.

**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.</description>
