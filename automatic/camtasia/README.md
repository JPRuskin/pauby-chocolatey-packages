## Notes

- TechSmith seem to be okay with releasing a new version of the same version. This throws out the checksum of the package. Until the next version is released, please use the `--ignore-checksums` switch with Chocolatey CLI.
- The Camtasia installer does not remove the previous major software version from your system. Please manually uninstall any old major versions.
- This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
