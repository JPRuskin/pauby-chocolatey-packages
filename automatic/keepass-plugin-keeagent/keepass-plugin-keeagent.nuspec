This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->
<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

        <summary>Allow SSH keys stored in a KeePass database to be used for SSH authentication by other programs</summary>
        <description>KeeAgent is a plugin for KeePass 2.x. It allows other programs to access SSH keys stored in your KeePass database for authentication. It can either act as a stand-alone agent or it can interface with an external agent.

* Store your SSH private keys in your KeePass 2.x database and use KeePass as your SSH agent (replaces Pageant on Windows).
* Keys can be configured to automatically load when a KeePass database is opened and unload when the database is closed/locked.
* Cross-platform: work on Windows/Linux/Mac.
* Supports both PuTTY and OpenSSH private key formats, (new in Beta v0.7.0, includes the “new” OpenSSH key format introduced in OpenSSH 6.5).
* Supports SSH1 and SSH2 keys.
* SSH2 key formats include RSA, DSA and ECDSA (new in Beta v0.7.0, includes Ed25519 support).
* Works with both PuTTY (and PuTTY compatible programs) and Cygwin/Msys on Windows.
* Works with native SSH agent on Linux/Mac.

**NOTE**: This package will not install unless you have either `keepass`, `keepass.install` or `keepass.portable` installed.
**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
