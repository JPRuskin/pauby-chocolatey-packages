<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/create-packages -->

This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->

    <description>With IPVanish, your internet traffic is routed through the secure server of your choosing. This helps protect your online identity and helps prevent advertisers, and network hackers from monitoring your activity.

## Simplified data protection

It takes just one tap to defend your online data using our VPN app. Unite security and convenience through advanced settings that help protect your online activity automatically, so you don’t have to remember.

## Powerful internet privacy

Our anonymous IP addresses shield your internet traffic from third-party spying. Armor your Wi-Fi network connection, guard your location data, and keep your activity confidential with the best online privacy shield.

## Use IPVanish on every device you own

Why sacrifice the protection of one device for another? We don’t meter simultaneous VPN connections or installations, so you’ll never have to choose.

## Notes

- The install and uninstall is not silent but is automated.
- The IPVanish software is problematic to automate. Please have patience, and let the maintainer know, if they change the installer and it stops working.
- This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
