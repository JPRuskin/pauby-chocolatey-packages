This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->
<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

        <description>This is an Open Source tool designed to help developers create, update, and submit manifest files to the WinGet repository.

Developers will use this tool to submit their applications for use with WinGet.

**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.

        <releaseNotes>This release contains several bug fixes related to parsing portable and zip installers for both the new and update command. There is now support for overriding the scope of a provided installer URL. This can be done by appending the intended scope value to the end of the installer url using the `|` character. Make sure to enclose the entire string in quotes since the `|` symbol is a special character in terminal.

``` &quot;&lt;installerUrl&gt;|user&quot; ```

Special thanks to @mdanish-kh for the help and contribution!
