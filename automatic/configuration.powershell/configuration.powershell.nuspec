<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->

This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->
<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

        <description>A module for saving and loading settings and configuration objects for PowerShell modules (and scripts).

The Configuration module supports layered configurations with default values, and serializes objects and hashtables to the simple PowerShell metadata format with the ability to extend how your custom types are serialized, so your configuration files are just .psd1 files!

The key feature is that you don't have to worry about where to store files, and modules using the Configuration commands will be able to easily store data even when installed in write-protected folders like Program Files.

Supports WindowsPowerShell, as well as PowerShell Core on Windows, Linux and OS X.

You can pass the following parameters:

* `/core`     - Installs the module in the AllUsers scope for PowerShell Core;
* `/desktop`  - Installs the module in the AllUsers scope for Windows PowerShell (ie. Desktop Edition);

You can pass both `/core` and `/desktop` parameters to install on both. If you pass no parameters then `/desktop` is assumed.

**NOTE: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.**
