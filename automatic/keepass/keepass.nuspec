This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->
<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->

        <summary>Lightweight and easy-to-use password manager.</summary>
        <description>>KeePass is a free open source password manager, which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key file. So you only have to remember one single master password or select the key file to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known (AES and Twofish).

### 1.x and 2.x

KeePass currently is available in [two different editions](http://keepass.info/compare.html): 1.x and 2.x. They are fundamentally different (2.x is not based on 1.x). They mainly differ in portability and functionality.

KeePass 1.x may be obtained via chocolatey package [keepass-classic](https://chocolatey.org/packages/keepass-classic).
KeePass 2.x may be obtained via this package.
