LanguageTool is an Open Source proofreading software for English, French, German, Polish, Russian, and more than [20 other languages](https://languagetool.org/languages/). It finds many errors that a simple spell checker cannot detect.

## Notes

* The LanguageTool binaries are extracted to the `languagetool` folder of the local tools folder (by default `c:\tools` - see `Get-ToolsLocation`](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/functions/get-toolslocation)` for more information). This provides a consistent location for the binaries and allows easier management when upgrading versions.
* **NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
