The winget command line tool enables users to discover, install, upgrade, remove and configure applications on Windows 10 and Windows 11 computers. This tool is the client interface to the Windows Package Manager service.

## Notes:

- This WinGet-CLI software appears to require 'Microsoft.UI.Xaml.2.7' and does not work if a later (2.8+) version _only_ is installed.
- This is a manually updated package. If you find it out of date, please let the maintainer know using the 'Contact Maintainers' link on the package page.
